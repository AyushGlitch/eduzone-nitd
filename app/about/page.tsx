                            At Eduzone NIT-Delhi, our mission is clear: to make essential study materials easily accessible to students like you. Being a student myself, I understand the struggles of finding the right resources, especially during the stressful exam periods. That&apos;s why I created this platformâ€”to provide a centralized hub where you can access past year question papers, textbooks, and other relevant materials tailored to the courses and branches offered at the National Institute of Technology, Delhi.

                            To bring Eduzone NIT-Delhi to life, I&apos;ve relied on a range of technologies. 
                            Leveraging Next.js for seamless navigation and user experience through server-side rendering.
                            Prisma provides a robust ORM for efficient data management.
                            PostgreSQL ensures data reliability and scalability.
                            Tailwind CSS facilitates crafting sleek and responsive user interfaces, enhancing the overall browsing experience.
                            Google Drive is used to store the study materials, ensuring easy access and quick downloads.
                            ShadcnUI is used for the simple and clean UI components like Cards &amp; Buttons.
                            Prettier and ESLint are used for code formatting and linting, ensuring clean and consistent code.
                            Docker is used to containerize the PostGres database.

                            Why Static Site Generation?
                        </p>
                        <p className="font-normal text-lg -mt-3">
                            I chose to implement static site generation (SSG) for Eduzone NIT-Delhi to ensure consistent accessibility and reliability. Since all users have access to the same pages with the same data, and there&apos;s no need for personalized data such as logins, SSG was the optimal choice. By pre-rendering static HTML files for each page, I minimize server load and optimize performance, particularly during peak periods such as exam seasons. Hosting on free servers from platforms like GoogieHost and FreeWebHostMost enables me to maintain our services without incurring costs.

                            Eduzone NIT-Delhi is a personal project that I&apos;m passionate about. That&apos;s why the codebase is open-sourced on GitHub, allowing for transparency, collaboration, and community-driven development. I invite my fellow college mates from NIT Delhi to contribute to this project, as together, we can continuously enhance and refine our platform to meet the evolving needs of the student community.
